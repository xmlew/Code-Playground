# Code-Playground
Projects that I've done for fun, mainly to practice concepts or familiarize myself with a new language.

Currently Working On:
Poker Hand Generator.
Mahjong Calculator.

Future Ideas:
Using Mahjong Calculator and probabilities of winning hands to generate possible game states.
Poker Game with UI, or a working poker probability calculator.

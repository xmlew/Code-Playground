# Code-Playground
Projects that I've done for fun, mainly to practice concepts or familiarize myself with a new language.

Projects and their functionalities:

[Python] Simple Finances Calculator (May 2021): Key in your monthly savings, combined cost of desired item(s) and monetary value of any subsidies in $, and it will return the time you need to save for.


[Python] Poker Hand Generator (Jan 2022) (WIP): Generates a deck and hands for x number of players in Texas Hold'Em Poker, and shows the winning hand at the end of the round.


[Python] [Java] Mahjong Chip Calculator (Jan 2022) (Java Edition WIP): Assuming a standard 4-player game, calculates the new balance of players after each round. Written for Singaporean Mahjong, the code requires the input of starting chips, denominations and whether the 'shooter' version of the game is played.


[Python] Mahjong Game Simulator (Est. Jan-Feb 2022) (WIP): Building on the Chip Calculator, it simulates the profit and loss of a standard (16-round) mahjong game using different types of ballpark probabilities of winning amounts per game. Simulations can be run as many times as possible and the option to generate the data as a csv will be provided for data visualization purposes.


Feel free to comment on any of these projects on any suggestions/features you'd like me to add!
